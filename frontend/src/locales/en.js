    p2: "This application is part of my Bachelor's Thesis (TFG) in Software Engineering. The application is designed to demonstrate my skills in developing web applications using modern technologies such as React.js and Material-UI, as well as the Spring Boot framework for backend development. This application is an example of my work and demonstrates my ability to design, develop, and deploy functional and attractive web applications.",
    p3: "The project was created to help students coordinate their academic work, such as Bachelor's Theses (TFG), Master's Theses (TFM), or doctoral theses, with their teachers more efficiently. The web application centralizes relevant information and offers features to simplify the management of academic projects, such as role assignment, real-time communication, and report generation. The main objective is to optimize communication and collaboration between teachers and graduate students, using modern technologies to ensure long-term efficiency and adaptability.",
